# Sub-Module: DirectX Mess (`Cheat Engine/Direct x mess/`)

## Purpose/Functionality

The "DirectX Mess" module is responsible for providing in-game overlay and snapshot capabilities for Cheat Engine. It achieves this by injecting DLLs into the target game process that hook specific DirectX functions. This allows Cheat Engine to draw its own graphics (text, sprites, menus) directly onto the game's display and to capture screenshots or video streams of the game.

It supports multiple versions of DirectX:
*   DirectX 9
*   DirectX 10
*   DirectX 11

Key functionalities include:
*   **Rendering Overlays:** Drawing text, textures (sprites), and basic shapes on top of the game's visuals. This is used for displaying menus, cheat information, crosshairs, etc.
*   **Taking Snapshots:** Capturing the game's rendered frames.
*   **Modifying Render States:** Applying effects like wireframe mode or disabling the Z-buffer.
*   **Mouse Clipping:** Confining the mouse cursor within the game window.
*   **Console Interaction:** Potentially displaying a console or capturing input for console commands within the game overlay.

## Structure

The module is organized into several sub-projects, each targeting a specific DirectX version or providing common functionality:

*   **`CED3D9Hook/`**: Contains the C++ project for hooking DirectX 9.
    *   `CED3D9Hook.cpp`: Main source file implementing the D3D9 hooks and overlay rendering logic.
    *   `CED3D9Hook.h`: Header file for the D3D9 hook.
    *   `CED3D9Hook.vc(x)proj`: Visual Studio project file.
*   **`CED3D10Hook/`**: Contains the C++ project for hooking DirectX 10.
    *   `CED3D10Hook.cpp`: Main source file for D3D10 hooks.
    *   `CED3D10Hook.h`: Header file.
    *   `CED3D10Hook.vc(x)proj`: Visual Studio project file.
*   **`CED3D11Hook/`**: Contains the C++ project for hooking DirectX 11.
    *   `CED3D11Hook.cpp`: Main source file for D3D11 hooks.
    *   `CED3D11Hook.h`: Header file.
    *   `CED3D11Hook.vc(x)proj`: Visual Studio project file.
*   **`DXHookBase/`**: A base library likely containing shared code or utilities used by the specific DirectX version hooks.
    *   `DXHookBase.cpp`, `DXHookBase.h`: Implementation and header for common hooking functionalities.
    *   `DXHookBase.vc(x)proj`: Visual Studio project file.
*   **`Direct x mess.sln`**: The main Visual Studio Solution file that groups all these DirectX hooking projects.
*   **`d3dhookshared.h`**: A crucial header file defining the shared memory structure (`D3DHookShared`) used for communication between the main Cheat Engine application (user-mode, Pascal) and the injected hook DLLs (in-process, C++).

**Shared Memory Structure (`D3DHookShared` in `d3dhookshared.h`):**
This structure facilitates communication and data exchange:
*   Pointers to original and hooked DirectX functions.
*   Paths for CE's directory and snapshot storage.
*   Control flags (e.g., `wireframe`, `disabledzbuffer`, `clipmouseinwindow`).
*   Overlay click coordinates (`clickedx`, `clickedy`).
*   Texture management: `texturelistHasUpdate`, `textureCount`, `texturelist` (pointer to an array of `TextureEntry`), `TextureLock` (for synchronization). Each `TextureEntry` contains image data and font map information if it's a font texture.
*   Render commands: An array of `D3DRenderCommand` structures (`RenderCommands`) that specify what to draw (sprites or text), where, with what properties (alpha, rotation, texture ID, font ID).
*   Snapshot settings: `snapshotKey`, `snapshotImageFormat`, `canDoSnapshot`.
*   Console data: `consolekey`, visibility, last message.

## Build Process

*   The DLLs for each DirectX version hook (`CED3D9Hook.dll`, `CED3D10Hook.dll`, `CED3D11Hook.dll`) and the base library (`DXHookBase.dll`, if it's a separate DLL) are compiled using **Visual Studio**.
*   The `Direct x mess.sln` solution file manages these C++ projects.
*   These compiled DLLs are then used by the main Cheat Engine application, which injects them into the target game process.

## Core Mechanism & Logic

1.  **Injection:** Cheat Engine injects the appropriate version-specific hook DLL into the target game process.
2.  **Initialization (`InitializeD3DHookDll`):** Once loaded into the game's address space, the DLL initializes. This involves:
    *   Finding the addresses of the DirectX functions to be hooked (e.g., `Present`, `Reset`, `DrawIndexedPrimitive`). This can be done by creating a dummy DirectX device and reading its virtual method table (VMT).
    *   Setting up hooks on these functions. This typically involves replacing the original function pointers in the VMT with pointers to custom hook functions within the DLL. The original function pointers are saved.
    *   Mapping or accessing the `D3DHookShared` memory region, which CE's main application also has access to.
3.  **Communication via Shared Memory:**
    *   Cheat Engine (Pascal side) writes commands and data into the `D3DHookShared` structure. This includes texture data for fonts or sprites, and a list of `D3DRenderCommand`s detailing what to draw.
    *   The hook DLL reads from this shared structure to know what to render.
4.  **Hook Execution (e.g., `D3D9Hook_Present_imp` from `CED3D9Hook.cpp`):**
    *   When the game calls a hooked DirectX function (e.g., `IDirect3DDevice9::Present`), the custom hook function in the DLL is executed instead.
    *   **Call Original Function:** The hook function usually first calls the original DirectX function (using the saved pointer) to allow the game to render its scene normally.
    *   **Overlay Rendering (`DXMessD3D9Handler::RenderOverlay`):**
        *   After the game has drawn, the hook function takes over.
        *   It checks the `shared->texturelistHasUpdate` flag and calls `UpdateTextures()` if CE has updated any textures. This involves creating or updating DirectX texture objects from the image data provided by CE.
        *   It iterates through the `shared->RenderCommands` array.
        *   For `rcDrawSprite` commands, it configures and draws the specified texture (sprite) at the given coordinates with specified transformations (scaling, rotation, alpha).
        *   For `rcDrawFont` commands, it uses a pre-rendered font texture (font map) and `DrawString()` like functions to render text character by character.
    *   **Snapshotting (`DXMessD3D9Handler::TakeSnapshot`):** If snapshot flags are set in `D3DHookShared`, the hook captures the current back buffer content (e.g., using `D3DXSaveSurfaceToFileInMemory` or `D3DXSaveSurfaceToFileA`) and saves it.
    *   **State Modification:** If flags like `shared->wireframe` or `shared->disabledzbuffer` are set, the hook function modifies the DirectX render states (e.g., `SetRenderState(D3DRS_FILLMODE, D3DFILL_WIREFRAME)`) before the game's draw calls (or around specific hooked draw calls) and restores them afterwards.
5.  **Cleanup:** When the hook is no longer needed or the game exits, the DLL should ideally unhook the functions and release resources.

**Key Classes/Functions (Example from D3D9):**
*   **`DXMessD3D9Handler` class:** Manages D3D9-specific resources like `ID3DXSprite`, textures, and font maps. It handles the main overlay rendering logic.
*   **`D3D9Hook_Present_imp`:** Hook for `IDirect3DDevice9::Present`. Orchestrates the overlay rendering after the game's frame is presented.
*   **`D3D9Hook_Reset_imp`:** Hook for `IDirect3DDevice9::Reset`. Handles device reset events, ensuring overlay resources (like sprites) are properly released (`OnLostDevice`) and recreated (`OnResetDevice`).
*   **`D3D9Hook_Draw*Primitive*_imp` functions:** Hooks for various drawing primitives. These are primarily used for snapshotting (to capture the state before/after specific draw calls) and for applying render state changes like wireframe mode.
*   **`UpdateTextures()`:** Dynamically updates or creates textures in the game process based on data provided by the main CE application through the shared memory region.
*   **`DrawString()`:** Renders text using a font texture map.

Similar structures and principles apply to the `CED3D10Hook` and `CED3D11Hook` components, adapted for their respective DirectX versions (e.g., using `IDXGISwapChain::Present` for DX10/11).

## Interface with Main Cheat Engine Application

*   The main CE application (Pascal) is responsible for:
    *   Injecting the correct hook DLL into the target process.
    *   Allocating and managing the `D3DHookShared` memory block.
    *   Populating `D3DHookShared` with texture data, font maps, and render commands based on user actions or Lua scripts.
    *   Setting control flags (wireframe, snapshot requests, etc.) in `D3DHookShared`.
    *   Receiving information back from the hook, such as click events on the overlay.
*   This interaction is primarily managed through the `Cheat Engine/d3dhookUnit.pas` unit on the Pascal side, which would contain the logic to prepare the shared memory and signal the hook DLL.
