# Sub-Module: DBVM - In-VMM Lua Scripting

This sub-module refers to the Lua scripting environment that is embedded directly within the DBVM (Dark Byte Virtual Machine) hypervisor itself. This is a distinct Lua environment from the one used in the user-mode Cheat Engine application and serves very different, lower-level purposes.

## Purpose/Functionality

The In-VMM Lua scripting capability provides a powerful way to interact with and control the DBVM hypervisor at runtime, from within the hypervisor's own privileged context (Ring -1 / Host Mode).

Its primary functions include:

*   **VMM Development and Debugging:** Allows DBVM developers to:
    *   Interactively test internal VMM functions and data structures.
    *   Inspect raw hardware state (MSRs, I/O ports, memory) directly.
    *   Prototype new hypervisor features or behaviors rapidly.
*   **Dynamic VMM Customization:** Enables loading Lua scripts that can:
    *   Modify how the VMM handles specific VM Exits.
    *   Alter guest state or VMX control structures (VMCS) dynamically.
    *   Implement custom responses to specific guest OS actions or hardware events.
    *   Extend VMM functionality without needing to recompile the entire hypervisor.
*   **Low-Level Hardware Interaction:** Provides scripts with direct access to CPU and hardware functionalities typically only available to the VMM.

This scripting environment is **not** intended for typical game cheating scripts (which run in Cheat Engine's user-mode Lua environment). Instead, it's a tool for advanced VMM manipulation and research.

## Structure

*   **`dbvm/vmm/lua/` Directory:** This directory contains a full copy of the Lua 5.1 C source code. This means Lua is compiled directly into the DBVM VMM binary, rather than DBVM linking against an external Lua DLL.
*   **`dbvm/vmm/luahandler.c`:** This C source file within the VMM code is responsible for:
    *   Initializing and managing the embedded Lua state (`lua_State`).
    *   Registering custom C functions (from the VMM's codebase) to be callable from Lua scripts running within the VMM. These are the bindings that expose VMM/hardware functionality to Lua.
*   **`dbvm/vmm/luahandler.h`:** Header file for `luahandler.c`.

## Mechanism

1.  **Initialization (`initializeLua()` in `luahandler.c`):**
    *   When DBVM initializes (likely during `vmm_entry` in `dbvm/vmm/main.c`), it calls `initializeLua()`.
    *   This function creates a new global Lua state (`LuaVM = luaL_newstate()`).
    *   It opens the standard Lua libraries (base, table, string, math, etc.) using `luaL_openlibs(LuaVM)`.
    *   Crucially, it then registers several custom C functions, implemented in `luahandler.c` or other VMM modules, into this Lua state using `lua_register()`. These functions serve as the bridge between Lua scripts and the VMM's capabilities.

2.  **Exposed Functions to In-VMM Lua:**
    The `luahandler.c` file shows examples of functions exposed to the VMM's Lua environment:
    *   `lua_print()`: Outputs strings to the VMM's serial console (used for debugging).
    *   `lua_cpuid()`: Executes the `CPUID` instruction and returns the results.
    *   `lua_readMSR(msr_address)`: Reads a Model Specific Register.
    *   `lua_writeMSR(msr_address, value)`: Writes to an MSR.
    *   `lua_inportb(port)`, `lua_inportd(port)`: Reads from I/O ports.
    *   `lua_outportb(port, value)`, `lua_outportd(port, value)`: Writes to I/O ports.
    *   `lua_readBytes(address, size)`: Reads a sequence of bytes directly from the VMM's address space (which could be mapped physical memory or VMM virtual memory). Returns data as a Lua table.
    *   `lua_writeBytes(address, byte_table)`: Writes bytes from a Lua table to a memory address.
    *   `lua_psod()`: Triggers a "Pink Screen of Death," DBVM's custom crash/debug screen.

3.  **Script Execution:**
    *   **Interactive Console (`enterLuaConsole()`):** DBVM provides an interactive Lua console accessible via its serial output (if enabled). This allows a developer to type Lua commands directly into the running VMM and see immediate results or trigger actions.
    *   **Preloaded Scripts (Potentially):** While not explicitly shown in the snippets, a VMM could be designed to load and execute Lua scripts from its boot image or a designated memory location upon startup or in response to specific events.

## Build Process

*   The Lua source code from `dbvm/vmm/lua/src/` is compiled along with the rest of the DBVM VMM C code using the Makefiles in the `dbvm/` directory (typically with GCC).
*   `luahandler.c` is also compiled as part of the VMM.
*   The result is a single VMM binary that includes the Lua interpreter and the VMM-specific Lua bindings.

## Interface with Other DBVM Components

*   The In-VMM Lua environment is tightly integrated with the rest of the DBVM VMM.
*   Functions registered from C (like `lua_readMSR`) directly call other C functions within the VMM that perform the actual hardware interactions or VMM operations.
*   It operates at the same privilege level as the VMM itself.

This internal Lua scripting engine provides an exceptionally flexible and powerful tool for VMM developers to debug, extend, and dynamically control the behavior of the DBVM hypervisor.
