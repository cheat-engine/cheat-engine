# Inter-Module Relationships in Cheat Engine

This document outlines how the primary modules of Cheat Engine (Cheat Engine Main Application, DBKKernel, DBVM, and Lua) interact with each other to provide its comprehensive feature set.

## Core Interaction Flow

The general hierarchy and interaction flow can be visualized as:

```
+---------------------------+
| User (Interacting with UI)|
+-------------+-------------+
              |
              v
+---------------------------+
| Cheat Engine (Main App)   |<-- (Pascal) --> Lua (User-Mode Scripting)
| (User Mode - Pascal, C++) |
+-------------+-------------+
    |         ^         |
    | (IOCTLs)|         | (Uses functions exposed by Lua DLL)
    |         |(Optional)|
    v         |         |
+---------------------------+
| DBKKernel (Kernel Driver) |<-- (vmcall) --> DBVM (Hypervisor / VMM)
| (Kernel Mode - C, Asm)    |                   (Ring -1 / Host Mode - C, Asm)
+---------------------------+                         |
                                                      v
                                             Lua (In-VMM Scripting)
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                          +---------------------+
                                          | Hardware (CPU, Mem) |
                                          +---------------------+

## Detailed Relationships

1.  **Cheat Engine (Main App) <-> Lua (User-Mode Scripting)**
    *   **Embedding:** The Cheat Engine main application embeds the Lua 5.1 interpreter. This is typically done by linking against `lua5.1.dll` (or a statically compiled version).
    *   **Bindings:**
        *   Cheat Engine exposes a vast number of its internal functions and data structures to the Lua environment. This is achieved through Pascal units like `LuaHandler.pas` which use the Lua C API to register Pascal functions and create Lua userdata representing CE objects (e.g., forms, memory records, address lists, debugger controls).
        *   Examples: `LuaForm.pas`, `LuaMemoryRecord.pas`, `LuaAddresslist.pas`, `LuaD3DHook.pas`.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Users write Lua scripts that can call these exposed CE functions to:
            *   Automate memory scanning and manipulation.
            *   Control the debugger.
            *   Modify the address list (cheat table).
            *   Create custom GUI elements (forms, buttons) within CE.
            *   Implement complex game-specific logic for trainers.
            *   Draw overlays using DirectX hooks.
    *   **Communication:** Direct function calls from Lua to Pascal (via registered CFunctions) and vice-versa (Pascal calling Lua functions like `lua_pcall` or `luaL_dostring` via `LuaHandler.pas`).

2.  **Cheat Engine (Main App) <-> DBKKernel (Kernel Driver)**
    *   **Communication Channel:** The primary communication mechanism is through **Device I/O Control (IOCTLs)**.
        *   The Cheat Engine application (user-mode) opens a handle to the device object created by DBKKernel (e.g., `\\.\DBK64`).
        *   It then uses the `DeviceIoControl` Windows API function to send command codes (IOCTLs) and associated data buffers to the driver.
    *   **Interface Units (User-Mode Side):**
        *   `Cheat Engine/dbk32/DBK32functions.pas`: Contains Pascal function wrappers that encapsulate the `DeviceIoControl` calls for specific operations (e.g., `dbk_OpenProcess`, `dbk_ReadProcessMemoryKernel`, `dbk_WriteProcessMemoryKernel`).
        *   `Cheat Engine/NewKernelHandler.pas`: Likely provides a higher-level abstraction or selection mechanism for using kernel functions.
    *   **Driver-Side Handling:**
        *   `DBKKernel/DBKDrvr.c`'s `DispatchIoctl` function receives these IOCTLs. A large switch statement routes the request to the appropriate internal kernel function based on the `ioControlCode`.
    *   **Functionality Provided by DBKKernel to Main App:**
        *   Privileged process opening.
        *   Kernel-mode memory reading/writing (can bypass some user-mode hooks or protections).
        *   Access to hardware debug registers (via kernel functions that wrap MSR reads/writes or specific debug APIs).
        *   Kernel-mode process and thread enumeration/manipulation.
        *   Loading/unloading parts of DBVM or controlling its features if DBVM is also loaded.
        *   Ultimap functionality.

3.  **DBKKernel (Kernel Driver) <-> DBVM (Hypervisor/VMM)**
    *   **Loading/Control:**
        *   DBKKernel might be involved in loading or communicating parameters to DBVM if DBVM is not booted as the primary host (e.g., if DBVM is loaded "on-the-fly" by the driver, though this is less common for full hypervisors). More typically, DBVM would be loaded first (via UEFI or its own bootloader).
        *   The `loadedbydbvm` flag in `DBKDrvr.c` suggests DBVM can load DBKKernel.
    *   **Communication Channel:** The primary communication from the guest OS (where DBKKernel runs) to the DBVM hypervisor is via the **`VMCALL` instruction** (or `VMMCALL` for AMD).
    *   **`vmcall` Interface:**
        *   DBKKernel would execute a `VMCALL` with a specific command code in a register (e.g., EAX, as per `dbvm/vmm/docs/vmcall.txt`) and a pointer to a parameter structure.
        *   The DBVM VMM (`dbvm/vmm/vmcall.c`) handles these `VMCALL`s (which cause a VM Exit). It then performs the requested privileged operation in the host context.
    *   **Functionality Provided by DBVM to DBKKernel:**
        *   True physical memory reading/writing (bypassing guest OS page tables if needed).
        *   Memory cloaking control.
        *   Sysenter MSR manipulation.
        *   Interrupt redirection.
        *   MSR read/write access that is invisible to the guest OS.
        *   Ultimap control (which might involve DBVM setting up hardware breakpoints or other VMX features on behalf of DBKKernel).
        *   CR3 change callbacks (allowing DBKKernel to be notified by DBVM when the guest OS switches processes).

4.  **DBVM (Hypervisor/VMM) <-> Lua (In-VMM Scripting)**
    *   **Embedding:** The DBVM hypervisor itself (code in `dbvm/vmm/`) embeds a Lua interpreter.
    *   **Bindings:**
        *   `dbvm/vmm/luahandler.c` is responsible for exposing VMM internal functions and data structures to this embedded Lua environment.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Allows for dynamic scripting of the hypervisor's core behavior.
        *   Scripts running in this Lua instance can:
            *   Handle specific VM Exits.
            *   Modify VMCS fields.
            *   Interact with EPT/NPT to change memory mappings or permissions from the host perspective.
            *   Control virtual devices or APIC behavior.
            *   Implement custom responses to `vmcall`s or other events.
    *   **Communication:** Direct function calls within the VMM's C code and the embedded Lua C API. This is a very low-level and powerful scripting capability, distinct from the user-mode Lua scripting in the main CE application.

5.  **Cheat Engine (Main App) -> DBVM (Hypervisor/VMM) (Indirectly)**
    *   There's no direct IOCTL or simple API call from the Cheat Engine user-mode application directly to DBVM.
    *   Instead, Cheat Engine commands DBKKernel (via IOCTLs).
    *   DBKKernel then, if necessary and if DBVM is active, makes `VMCALL`s to DBVM to request hypervisor-level services.
    *   This creates a layered approach: User App -> Kernel Driver -> Hypervisor.

## Summary of Data Flow and Control

*   **User Input & High-Level Logic:** Resides in the **Cheat Engine Main App**. Users interact with the GUI, and the Pascal code orchestrates operations. Lua scripts (user-mode) extend this logic.
*   **Privileged OS Operations:** When operations require kernel privileges (e.g., raw memory access, advanced process manipulation, driver loading), the Main App sends IOCTLs to **DBKKernel**.
*   **Hypervisor-Level Stealth/Control:** If even deeper control or stealth is needed (e.g., to bypass kernel-level anti-cheats or to use VMX-specific features like EPT manipulation for memory hiding), DBKKernel makes `VMCALL`s to **DBVM**. DBVM executes these requests in the host context, invisible to the guest OS.
*   **Scripting Flexibility:**
    *   **User-Mode Lua:** Provides high-level scripting for automating CE features and creating trainers.
    *   **In-VMM Lua:** Provides low-level scripting for dynamically altering the hypervisor's behavior, offering extreme power for advanced anti-anti-cheat techniques or research.

This modular design allows Cheat Engine to operate at different levels of system privilege and stealth, adapting to various challenges posed by games and applications. Each module builds upon the capabilities of the one "below" it in terms of privilege.
