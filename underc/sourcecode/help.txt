UnderC Command Summary (available with #help)

#q     Quit session

#ql    Quit session, writing log file

  The temp file is of the form <month><day>-<hour><min>

#log   Write to <log file>

  Currently only available in the Win32 GUI version (WCON)

#cd    Change current directory <dir>

#pwd   Show current directory

#l     Load <file>

#r     Run current program

  This must have previously been loaded with #l

#lib   Load <library> <import-file>

  Any class declarations and function prototypes are
  then imported from the specified shared library or DLL.
  An optional import file can be used when linking DLLs without
  symbolic imformation.

  To end importing, it's important to say #lib (without a  parm)
  Note: this is exactly the same as #pragma dlink <file>

#alias Create an Alias for a Command

  Aliases are defined like #define macros, but only substitute
  the first token on the line, and pick up their arguments
  separated by spaces. Commands or preprocessor directives can 
  occur in the definition, and will be separated out; # has its
  usual meaning as the stringizing and token-pasting operators.

  For example,
    #alias cd(x) @cd x @pwd
    #alias D(obj,y,z) obj->set(y,z);
    #alias L(f) @include #f

  So the command "cd /test" is equivalent to
    #cd /test
    #pwd
  and 'D p 10 20' expands to 'p->set(10,20)'

#opt   Set Options

 For example, #opt t+ v+

 o- Auto Dissemble 
 t- Function Trace
 v- Verbose Mode
 s- Strict Mode   (no implicit bool conversions)
 p- Pointer Check
 a- Access Control
 c- Strip Prompt when Copying (WCON only)
 C- C mode
 T- Use typedef names if possible
 L- Suppress Link Errors

 The 'use typedefs' option is an interesting UnderC feature where
 the compiler tries to use any defined typedefs instead of long
 complex type names.  For example, if you have typedef'd IntMap
 to be map<string,int>, then that type will appear as IntMap
 in any error messages.

#lv    Display all local variables

#d     Display Variable

#v     Information on Variable or Function

#u     Dissemble Function

#rm    Remove Symbol or Program

  With 'main' as a parameter, removes the program.

#s     Stop Program

#mod   List Modules, or Position of Function

  Without a parameter, lists all loaded modules
  If given a function name, gives the file name and line number

#types List Types <pat>

  Can be given wildcards of the form pat* or *pat

#funs  List Functions <pat>

  Can be given wildcards of the form pat* or *pat

#gt    Set Temporary Breakpoint at <file> <lineno>

#b     Set Breakpoint at <file> <lineno>

#bs    List Breakpoints in <file> 

  This can also be used to set a number of breakpoints in a file,
  when they have already been set with #b.  The new line numbers
  follow the file name

#ff    Set Frame <n>

#mc    Clear All Macros

  This will also clean out the global namespace.
