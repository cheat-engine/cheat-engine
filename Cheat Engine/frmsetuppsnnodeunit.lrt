TFRMSETUPPSNNODE.CBMAXFOUNDRESULTS.HINT=This will terminate all the children and disconnect from the parent after having found at least the given amount of results
It's slightly innacurate as the check is only done every 10 seconds or so

Note: This only has effect when there is at least one parent in the queue. Otherwise it's not going to disconnect
TFRMSETUPPSNNODE.CBMAXFOUNDRESULTS.CAPTION=Stop scans after finding max amount of results
TFRMSETUPPSNNODE.CBMAXTIMETOSCAN.HINT=This will terminate all the children and disconnect from the parent after scanning for the given amount of time.

Note: This only has effect when there is at least one parent in the queue. Otherwise it's not going to disconnect

TFRMSETUPPSNNODE.CBCONNECTTOOTHERNODE.CAPTION=Connect to other node as
TFRMSETUPPSNNODE.CBAUTOTRUSTCHILDREN.HINT=Normally when a worker terminates before the scan is done it will send all its paths to its connected node and then close, but if the system would crash it wouldn't be able to send its queues to the node, causing in a loss of possible paths to examine

When unchecked the owning controller/scanner will only send it one pointerpath queue element at a time and remembers that queue element until the worker reports that it has 0 queue elements, meaning it successfully completed the work item.
Also note that under normal circumstaces the node will accept new paths from the worker, but in the case of non stable workers this is not done and the worker has to do all the sub paths it generated itself

In the node screen you will be able to change the state of a worker

TFRMSETUPPSNNODE.CBALLOWTEMPFILES.HINT=When checked it will save the scandata files it receives into temporary files on the harddisk
If it's unchecked these files will stay in memory in their original file format as well as their extracted format

This can be useful when on a system with no disk access but lots of RAM
