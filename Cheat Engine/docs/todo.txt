$C remove/rename symbols that are obtained from linking


mono: .net info search for mono: search for result/parameter
mono/il2cpp: debugging, resuming and then activating mono seems to give an error
addresslist: add groupboxs like entries that auto deactivate the other entries on activate first

when there is an aa error in a memoryrecord, rightclick any other record shows it as well

aobscan non-zero flag (-2)


tracer search: Skips calls taken (like call qword [xxx])

hotkeys: Hotkey while down addresslist record hotkey (with a restore to set or saved value)


ceshare request window: 
  make scrolling smooth
  add option to delete your own request

ceshare: publish has colors in dark mode even in light mode


saved scanresults are not deleted on new scan


ceshare initial description field is too small (autosize issue I guess)

pointerscan: make the last offset tabable


form editor:  in dark mode the edit fields are white text with white background


Mac: Hex editing files


paging window is not dpi aware
manual staktrace is not dpi aware, not 64-bit aware, and buggy
network connect display is not dpi aware

{$luacode} might like the allocated memory addresses afterwards  (perhaps generate a table with these variables inside the ref can later be filled in)

DPI: symbol config address field is not correct

DBVM: Add a "start record all PA access"  "stop record all PA access" which records the PA, VA, CR3, CS:RIP for each access
DBVM: Add a local break and trace (not undetected single step flag)


DBVM: give the "find what this instruction accessess" it's own dbvm config window so it doesn't override the userdefined options

'sub rsp,20+(4*8)+(6*8)'
set value to -888,12  (not -888.12) and see what happens


structure dissect: 
  delete all structures sometimes AV's (no idea how to reproduce)

lua function call: make it generate a full routine based on parameters to get, including stacksafe call



memview paste: paste for specific displaytype
memview->rightclick while debugging: Change eip to position, run till position in the context menu as well


trainergen: get rid of tcheat and just use labels

graphical memory view: 
  change format makes it black sometimes(loses position ?)
  sometimes the x position is not 0, but can't be changed back

graphical tutorial: continue with it

linux: make a 32-bit linux build with .so injection support
memscan: Don't combine the scanresults into a single file. Leave them split up (skip: for 6.7 or 7.0)

pseudocode: continue with it
mac version: work on it

define from debug data: Use a ownerdata list instead (or better, a whole new interface where you can see beforehand the layout)

structure compare: Closed a previous structure compare followed by reopening a new one and loading a file, messes up the popupmode and other stuff
pointerscan: generating pointermap should also check terminated
pointerscan: when suspending a scan, CE closed itself(crash)

test and fix the d3dhook stuff and trainer generator.  (perhaps dx12 support as well)


a timer causing a lua_error will eventually show c stack overflow


mono plugin: When enumerating classes instead of getting a class get the typedefs only and get the info from the typedef info until an actual class is requested/expanded
