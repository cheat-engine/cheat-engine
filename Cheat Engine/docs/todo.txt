test nmi's in windows in dbvm

ceserver historylist  (and perhaps find out why discovery is broken)

fontcolor in ultimap2 edit fields for seconds and filesize is wrong in dark mode

check if the system uses 'efficient' cores and if so, do not force the scans to use those affinity

luacode and ccode in macos (ccode likely uses windows calling convention)

ctrl+space to sync disasembler with hexview is broken
referencedBytes in trace seems to not work
ultimap2 default view is too small for high dpi

import list of instructions from "what accesses this" into ultimap


frmregisters seems to have the wrong values
autoassemble execute seems to do a full symbollist enum ?
assembling in thuimbmode seems to not negate the extra bit
thumb might not be correct

add option for big endian pointer support


tcc: not all code is debugable/visible(see script at https://pastebin.com/MZGaJ0Su )

break and trace compare gives access violation  (unreprocducable)
fix/rewrite thumb disAssembler


{$luacode sync} parameter
{$luacode newluastate} parameter

luacode for mac
luacode for ceserver (create a socket in the target which connects to ceserver, and ceserver connects to ce)

lua editor AND aa editor: when inside a string, the {$asm} inside the string disables lua mode.  Boith the parser and AA need to deal with that

add symbol path configuration
structure spider: dpi fixes (default window size and base address edit fields)
structure spider: doubleclick on column 2 value should make you go there

mac/aarch64: show S registers (similar to xmm)
mac:pointerscan sort by offset
mac: memview/disassembler updates in a seperate thread and only render when done

hexview: Select bytes->show disassembly (easy shortcut)

vehdebug on tutorial-i386 fails (dll inject crashes tutorial)
.net info: invoke method: String  (need to create a sting obnject from string)

.net info: doubleclick on type of a field brings you to that type
.net info: typing in the classes search should wait 250 ms before scanning fore the input.  (really improve smoothess in general)
structure dissect : Nested structure

Hexview typelink/colors

autoassembler coloring fix

enumsymbols lua command: add way to figure out duplicates

ce debug and dbvm: changeregonbp , add option for 1 time only

mono: .net info search for mono: search for result/parameter
mono/il2cpp: debugging, resuming and then activating mono seems to give an error
addresslist: add groupboxs like entries that auto deactivate the other entries on activate first

when there is an aa error in a memoryrecord, rightclick any other record shows it as well

aobscan non-zero flag (-2)


tracer search: Skips calls taken (like call qword [xxx])

hotkeys: Hotkey while down addresslist record hotkey (with a restore to set or saved value)


ceshare request window: 
  make scrolling smooth
  add option to delete your own request

ceshare: publish has colors in dark mode even in light mode


saved scanresults are not deleted on new scan


ceshare initial description field is too small (autosize issue I guess)

pointerscan: make the last offset tabable


form editor:  in dark mode the edit fields are white text with white background


Mac: Hex editing files


paging window is not dpi aware
manual staktrace is not dpi aware, not 64-bit aware, and buggy
network connect display is not dpi aware

{$luacode} might like the allocated memory addresses afterwards  (perhaps generate a table with these variables inside the ref can later be filled in)

DPI: symbol config address field is not correct

DBVM: Add a "start record all PA access"  "stop record all PA access" which records the PA, VA, CR3, CS:RIP for each access
DBVM: Add a local break and trace (not undetected single step flag)


DBVM: give the "find what this instruction accessess" it's own dbvm config window so it doesn't override the userdefined options

'sub rsp,20+(4*8)+(6*8)'
set value to -888,12  (not -888.12) and see what happens


structure dissect: 
  delete all structures sometimes AV's (no idea how to reproduce)

lua function call: make it generate a full routine based on parameters to get, including stacksafe call



memview paste: paste for specific displaytype
memview->rightclick while debugging: Change eip to position, run till position in the context menu as well


trainergen: get rid of tcheat and just use labels

graphical memory view: 
  change format makes it black sometimes(loses position ?)
  sometimes the x position is not 0, but can't be changed back

graphical tutorial: continue with it

linux: make a 32-bit linux build with .so injection support
memscan: Don't combine the scanresults into a single file. Leave them split up (skip: for 6.7 or 7.0)

pseudocode: continue with it
mac version: work on it

define from debug data: Use a ownerdata list instead (or better, a whole new interface where you can see beforehand the layout)

structure compare: Closed a previous structure compare followed by reopening a new one and loading a file, messes up the popupmode and other stuff
pointerscan: generating pointermap should also check terminated
pointerscan: when suspending a scan, CE closed itself(crash)

test and fix the d3dhook stuff and trainer generator.  (perhaps dx12 support as well)


a timer causing a lua_error will eventually show c stack overflow


mono plugin: When enumerating classes instead of getting a class get the typedefs only and get the info from the typedef info until an actual class is requested/expanded
