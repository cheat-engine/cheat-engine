ceserver debug: add option to exclude some threads from debugging

fix jvmti on windows (I messed up the lua)

.net info: getting the classlist takes long and it looks like nothing happens, and seems to wait till the symbol enum is done
.net info: add some grouped commands for data gathering
.net info: add option to skip the value fetcher
.net info: lookup instances should grey the button while the scan is going, and when done, dropdown the list for you
.net info: instance lookup: verify that pointers are actually null or point to a valid location (preferably of the correct classtype?), and booleans can only be 0 or 1
.net info: when il2cpp is being scanned, add a rightclick to the label at the bottom of ce's main screen that shows the progress, to cancel the enum
.net info: Make the static fields list also a virtualstringtree

ceserver:  accept new .elf files inside .apk.>0
CE connected to ceserver: Hide "Active memory only" option(s)

ceserver: did a binary scan. froze at the end
ceserver: did an aobscan (exec, ignore rest). froze at the end
ceserver: when debugging, also use multibyte writes using the available apis

processwindow: When going to the network window and connect, and then cancel because the server is down, then the proceslist has lost it's tabs

autoassembler: add autocomplete for stuff like createthread, alloc, etc...
autoassembler: Add a checkbox or something so it won't ask if you wish to keep certain symbols (always yes/always no?)

ceserver: try to demangle names (register both manged and demangled names)

symhandler: if _errno can't be found, look for a __errno instead (android thing)

enumerate dll's doesn't show some value entries like _ZN3art7Runtime9instance_E

lua engine code completion: string..get<ctrl+space> doesn't work. needs string.. get<ctrl+space> change it to .. does work
lua engine debug: highlight over array[index].name doesn't get the value. (Check if it is a table, and if so, get the table and then query the field)
lua engine debug: highlight over a table shows the table, but if you highlight table[index] it still shows the whole table instead of just that indexed entry

{$c}/{ccode}:  Provide a list of warnings
{$c}/{$ccode}: fix kernel allocation

codelist: Replace with nops: If a module in the list doesn't exist (or different process) an error is shown and it won't nop
codelist: replace with nops: if the address is already in the list it'll ask to add again.  It should just nop


AddressList : Make check expand/collapse icons dpi aware

lua doesn't show errors anymore if the error is inside a component/luacaller   e.g: blax==nil and then blax.xxxx();
for class fetching in java for android, add a downloadbar/progressbar

processlist with ceserver: rightclick refresh does nothing

ceserver: Add a pthread_create call that can be done without .so injection (so c-code can run all by itself)


memscan lua formula scan: value>oldvalue+1000 and value<oldvalue+2000 crashes CE  : value>previousvalue+1000 and value<previousvalue+2000 works  So: add syntaxchecking with values before starting the scan

auto assembler: 6 byte jmp option where CE will do a scan for a 8 byte codecave
auto assembler: 5 byte jmp option where CE will do a scan for a 14 byte codecave
DPI: form designer: anchor editor has crappy size on first time show

java info: expand arrays (max 20 or so)

form editor: add an order change option (not just bring to front/send to back)
form editor: deleting a column from a listview keeps it in the object inspector
form editor: when loading a form, the save dialog still points to the old one. Change that to the newly loaded formname
form editor: save objectinspector treeview height

binary type hotkey: increase value by doesn't work

ceshare list filter search has an error

macos: luaserver
macos: pointerscan column click sorting

vehdebug: ccode version

table lua script: ctrl+space completion
executeCodeLocalEx fails when no parameters are given

dbvm: switch emu yuzu fails to load any game when dbvm is running

dpi: change address dialog: sizefield is too small

signature: resize signature (new version sig?)

add table specific settings. E.g: show errors when activating table

ceshare: seach gives errors

---

dbvm: Change memory while on a breakpoint doesn't seem to apply it to the cloaked page



single hotkey keys sometimes stuck? sunbeam
type isn't saved on headers...

tracer search: keyboard focus should be on the input field


implement {$nonops} so it rewrites the instruction to force the correct size and then reassembles from the start


dbvm cloak: amd pageboundaries (maybe single step issue)
test nmi's in windows in dbvm

mac: hexview: implement meta+v for pasting
mac: all modules are seen as 32-bit on a aarch64 target
mac: aarch64 disassembler (addresses/labels should use the symbolhander)


fontcolor in ultimap2 edit fields for seconds and filesize is wrong in dark mode

check if the system uses 'efficient' cores and if so, do not force the scans to use those affinity

luacode and ccode in macos (ccode likely uses windows calling convention)


ultimap2 default view is too small for high dpi

import list of instructions from "what accesses this" into ultimap


frmregisters seems to have the wrong values
autoassemble execute seems to do a full symbollist enum ?
assembling in thuimbmode seems to not negate the extra bit
thumb might not be correct

add option for big endian pointer support


tcc: not all code is debugable/visible(see script at https://pastebin.com/MZGaJ0Su )

break and trace compare gives access violation  (unreprocducable)
fix/rewrite thumb disAssembler


{$luacode sync} parameter
{$luacode newluastate} parameter

luacode for mac
luacode for ceserver (create a socket in the target which connects to ceserver, and ceserver connects to ce)

lua editor AND aa editor: when inside a string, the {$asm} inside the string disables lua mode.  Boith the parser and AA need to deal with that

add symbol path configuration
structure spider: dpi fixes (default window size and base address edit fields)
structure spider: doubleclick on column 2 value should make you go there

mac/aarch64: show S registers (similar to xmm)
mac:pointerscan sort by offset
mac: memview/disassembler updates in a seperate thread and only render when done

hexview: Select bytes->show disassembly (easy shortcut)

vehdebug on tutorial-i386 fails (dll inject crashes tutorial)
.net info: invoke method: String  (need to create a sting object from string)

.net info: doubleclick on type of a field brings you to that type (in a new window, and if the value field is valid, set the address to that value)
.net info: mono: editing the System.Boolean type doesn't work
.net info: spawn the structure dissect window from the field list
.net info: Rightclick option: copy value to clipboard



structure dissect : Nested structure

Hexview typelink/colors

autoassembler coloring fix

enumsymbols lua command: add way to figure out duplicates

ce debug and dbvm: changeregonbp , add option for 1 time only

mono: .net info search for mono: search for result/parameter
mono/il2cpp: debugging, resuming and then activating mono seems to give an error
addresslist: add groupboxs like entries that auto deactivate the other entries on activate first

when there is an aa error in a memoryrecord, rightclick any other record shows it as well

aobscan non-zero flag (-2)


tracer search: Skips calls taken (like call qword [xxx])

hotkeys: Hotkey while down addresslist record hotkey (with a restore to set or saved value)


ceshare request window: 
  make scrolling smooth
  add option to delete your own request

ceshare: publish has colors in dark mode even in light mode


saved scanresults are not deleted on new scan


ceshare initial description field is too small (autosize issue I guess)

pointerscan: make the last offset tabable


form editor:  in dark mode the edit fields are white text with white background


Mac: Hex editing files


paging window is not dpi aware
manual staktrace is not dpi aware, not 64-bit aware, and buggy
network connect display is not dpi aware

{$luacode} might like the allocated memory addresses afterwards  (perhaps generate a table with these variables inside the ref can later be filled in)

DPI: symbol config address field is not correct

DBVM: Add a "start record all PA access"  "stop record all PA access" which records the PA, VA, CR3, CS:RIP for each access
DBVM: Add a local break and trace (not undetected single step flag)


DBVM: give the "find what this instruction accessess" it's own dbvm config window so it doesn't override the userdefined options

'sub rsp,20+(4*8)+(6*8)'
set value to -888,12  (not -888.12) and see what happens


structure dissect: 
  delete all structures sometimes AV's (no idea how to reproduce)

lua function call: make it generate a full routine based on parameters to get, including stacksafe call



memview paste: paste for specific displaytype
memview->rightclick while debugging: Change eip to position, run till position in the context menu as well


trainergen: get rid of tcheat and just use labels

graphical memory view: 
  change format makes it black sometimes(loses position ?)
  sometimes the x position is not 0, but can't be changed back

graphical tutorial: continue with it

linux: make a 32-bit linux build with .so injection support
memscan: Don't combine the scanresults into a single file. Leave them split up (skip: for 6.7 or 7.0)

pseudocode: continue with it
mac version: work on it

define from debug data: Use a ownerdata list instead (or better, a whole new interface where you can see beforehand the layout)

structure compare: Closed a previous structure compare followed by reopening a new one and loading a file, messes up the popupmode and other stuff
pointerscan: generating pointermap should also check terminated
pointerscan: when suspending a scan, CE closed itself(crash)

test and fix the d3dhook stuff and trainer generator.  (perhaps dx12 support as well)


a timer causing a lua_error will eventually show c stack overflow


mono plugin: When enumerating classes instead of getting a class get the typedefs only and get the info from the typedef info until an actual class is requested/expanded
