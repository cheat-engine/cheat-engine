# Sub-Module: DBKKernel - VMX Helpers & Offload

This sub-module within DBKKernel consists of two main parts: `vmxhelper` (for communicating with an active DBVM hypervisor) and `vmxoffload` (for loading and launching the DBVM hypervisor, effectively "hyperjacking" the system).

## 1. VMX Helper (`DBKKernel/vmxhelper.c`, `DBKKernel/vmxhelper.h`, `DBKKernel/amd64/vmxhelpera.asm`)

### Purpose/Functionality

The VMX Helper component acts as a **client library within DBKKernel** that allows it to communicate with an already running DBVM (Dark Byte Virtual Machine) hypervisor. When Windows (and thus DBKKernel) is running as a guest OS under DBVM, this helper module enables DBKKernel to request privileged operations or information from the DBVM host.

*   **`VMCALL` Interface:** It defines a comprehensive set of `VMCALL_*` constants (e.g., `VMCALL_GETVERSION`, `VMCALL_READ_PHYSICAL_MEMORY`, `VMCALL_ULTIMAP`, `VMCALL_CLOAK_ACTIVATE`). These constants correspond directly to the command API exposed by the DBVM hypervisor (documented in `dbvm/vmm/docs/vmcall.txt`).
*   **Wrapper Functions:** Provides Pascal-callable wrapper functions (e.g., `vmx_getversion()`, `vmx_getRealCR0()`, `vmx_ultimap()`) that construct the necessary data structures and use the core `vmcall()` assembly function to issue commands to DBVM.
*   **Cross-Vendor Support:** Includes logic (`vmx_init_dovmcall`) to use the correct instruction (`VMCALL` for Intel, `VMMCALL` for AMD) for hypervisor communication.

### Structure and Mechanism

1.  **`vmcall()` Assembly Function:**
    *   Located in `vmxhelpera.asm` (for 64-bit) or inline assembly in `vmxhelper.c` (for 32-bit).
    *   This function takes a pointer to a command structure and DBVM authentication passwords.
    *   It executes the `VMCALL` (or `VMMCALL`) instruction. This instruction causes a VM Exit, transferring control from the guest (DBKKernel) to the DBVM hypervisor.
    *   DBVM's VMCALL handler processes the command and returns a result, typically in a register, which `vmcall()` then returns to its C caller.
2.  **C Wrapper Functions in `vmxhelper.c`:**
    *   Each wrapper corresponds to a specific DBVM feature (e.g., `vmx_read_physical_memory`).
    *   It populates a command-specific structure with parameters.
    *   It calls the `vmcall()` assembly function with the structure and passwords.
    *   It returns the result obtained from DBVM.
3.  **Usage:** Other parts of DBKKernel (like Ultimap functions or memory access functions) can call these `vmx_*` wrappers if they need to leverage DBVM's capabilities (e.g., for stealthy MSR access, EPT-based memory hiding, or hypervisor-assisted breakpoints).

**In essence, `vmxhelper` does not implement hypervisor functionality itself but rather provides the API for DBKKernel to be a "client" of the DBVM hypervisor.**

## 2. VMX Offload (`DBKKernel/vmxoffload.c`, `DBKKernel/vmxoffload.h`, `DBKKernel/amd64/vmxoffloada.asm`)

### Purpose/Functionality

The VMX Offload component is responsible for the highly complex process of **loading the DBVM hypervisor and transitioning the currently running Windows operating system to execute as a guest VM under DBVM's control**. This is an "on-the-fly hyperjacking" mechanism.

*   **DBVM Loading:** Loads the DBVM hypervisor image (`dbvm.img`) from a file into physical memory.
*   **System State Preparation:** Sets up the necessary environment for DBVM to take control, including initial page tables and GDT for DBVM.
*   **OS State Preservation:** Saves the complete state of the current OS (all CPU registers, GDT, IDT, CR0, CR3, CR4, MSRs, etc.) into a designated memory structure (`OriginalState`).
*   **Multi-Core Transition:** Ensures that all CPU cores transition into VMX mode and start executing under DBVM.
*   **Guest Launch:** Initiates DBVM, which then uses the saved `OriginalState` to resume the original Windows OS as its primary guest.

### Structure and Mechanism

1.  **`initializeDBVM(PCWSTR dbvmimgpath)`:**
    *   This function, called once (likely at PASSIVE_LEVEL), prepares the system for DBVM.
    *   Allocates a 4MB contiguous block of physical memory for the DBVM VMM image.
    *   Reads the `dbvm.img` file into this memory.
    *   Sets up critical data structures for DBVM:
        *   **Initial Page Tables for DBVM:** Creates PML4, Page Directory Pointer Table, Page Directories, and Page Tables that DBVM will use immediately after taking control. These map DBVM's own code and initial data.
        *   **Initial GDT for DBVM:** Defines a new GDT for DBVM's host mode.
        *   **`enterVMM2` Area:** Allocates a small page in low physical memory (below 4MB) and copies a special assembly routine (`enterVMM`) into it. This routine handles the final steps of VMX entry, which must be done carefully (e.g., after paging is temporarily modified).
        *   **`OriginalState` Structure:** Allocates memory for this structure, which will hold the snapshot of the OS's state.
        *   **`INITVARS` Structure:** Populates a structure within the loaded `dbvm.img` (at a fixed offset like 0x10) with key physical addresses: the `OriginalState` PA, DBVM's PML4 PA, DBVM image base PA (`vmmPA`), and initial stack pointer for DBVM.
    *   Sets `initializedvmm = TRUE`.

2.  **`vmxoffload_dpc()` and `vmxoffload()`:**
    *   `vmxoffload_dpc` is a DPC (Deferred Procedure Call) routine that is queued to run on each CPU core. It calls `vmxoffload()`.
    *   `vmxoffload()`:
        *   Saves the current CPU's full context (GPRs, segment registers, CRs, DRs, MSRs like FSBASE/GSBASE, GDT/IDT base/limit) into the globally accessible `OriginalState` structure.
        *   Crucially, it sets `originalstate->rip` to point to `enterVMMEpilogue` (a label within the `enterVMM` assembly code). This is where the OS will "resume" after DBVM launches it as a guest.
        *   Calls/jumps to the `enterVMM` assembly routine (located at `enterVMM2PA` in low physical memory).

3.  **`enterVMM` (Assembly Routine - `vmxoffloada.asm` or inline):**
    *   This highly critical code executes with interrupts disabled.
    *   **Loads Temporary GDT:** Loads the GDT prepared by `initializeDBVM`.
    *   **Switches to Temporary Page Tables:** Sets CR3 to `TemporaryPagingSetupPA`. These page tables are set up to identity-map the `enterVMM2` physical page, allowing continued execution after paging is disabled.
    *   **Disables Paging:** Clears the PG bit in CR0.
    *   **Loads DBVM Page Tables:** Sets CR3 to `DBVMPML4PA` (DBVM's main PML4).
    *   **Enables Long Mode & VMX Features:** Sets necessary bits in EFER (LME) and CR4 (PAE, PSE, VMXE).
    *   **Re-enables Paging:** Sets the PG bit in CR0. The system is now running under DBVM's paging structures.
    *   **Jumps to DBVM Entry:** Performs a far jump to the main entry point of the DBVM VMM (e.g., `0x50:0x00400000` virtual, which DBVM's page tables map to `vmmPA`). It passes `originalstatePA` (for DBVM to know how to resume the OS) and `vmmPA` (DBVM's own base) as parameters.
    *   **`enterVMMEpilogue`:** A label within `enterVMM`. This is the address that `originalstate->rip` was set to. When DBVM eventually `VMLAUNCH`es the guest OS using the saved `OriginalState`, execution for the OS effectively "resumes" from this point, re-enabling interrupts and returning from the `vmxoffload` sequence.

4.  **`cleanupDBVM()`:** If DBVM needs to be unloaded or initialization fails, this function attempts to free the resources allocated by `initializeDBVM`.

**Relationship between VMX Helper and VMX Offload:**

*   **`vmxoffload`** is the component responsible for *installing and launching* the DBVM hypervisor, taking the system from a native OS environment to one where the OS runs as a guest under DBVM.
*   Once DBVM is active and the OS (with DBKKernel) is running as its guest, **`vmxhelper`** provides the API (via `VMCALL`) for DBKKernel to *interact with and request services from* the DBVM hypervisor.

They are sequential: `vmxoffload` enables DBVM, and then `vmxhelper` is used for ongoing communication with the active DBVM.
